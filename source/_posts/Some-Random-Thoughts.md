2020,08,04.
13 days before NOI. Have no passion to solve a problem.

Trying to set up my own blog.
Literally my OWN blog.
Want to be ME.
I think that I have had too my thoughts about others recently.
I mean...maybe the passed one year.
Seriosly, I'm tired of it.
It just seems that the more I think about others, the less hope and passion I have.
Of course, sometimes you see peopel are "not better" than you, and you feel "happy", just because you have the excuse to be "satisfy" with the currunt "you".
But no, that is not life should be like. That is not the "satisfaction" should be like.
So, I decide to BE ME.
and THINK ME.
Care of others, but don't care about others.

JUST BE YOU.

I want this place (my blog) to be completely personal, so I decided to write it in English.
(maybe) It is a symbol of the REAL ME, the one that doesn't exist in the daily life.
